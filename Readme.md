This project aims to develop a fine-tuned large language model *(7B parameter-sharded LLaMA)* capable of recommending products based on given text prompts. By leveraging the power of LLMs and incorporating product and department information, this model can provide personalized and relevant product suggestions to users.


**Key Features:**

Data Preprocessing: Combines product and department data to create a comprehensive dataset.

Model Training: Trains a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Llama-2) on the combined dataset using techniques like PEFT for efficient fine-tuning.

Text Generation: Generates product recommendations based on user-provided text prompts.

Evaluation: Assesses the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.
